# Project Plan
## Title
Economic Inequality and Health Outcomes in North vs. South America

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Do economic factors impact health in the Americas?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Being healthy is an important factor in human life. 
There is a difference in lifestyle we can see in American countries, especially in two different regions. In this research, I would like to explore the key factors of being well. There are many more factors that are significant for human health; I believe that economic stability is one of them. Therefore, finding out the influence of economic factors on health is a potential research topic. The goal of this project is to find out the key factors of healthcare that have a direct influence on human health. To do so, two datasets have been selected that contain data from both regions of America. Upon completion of this research, we may gain insights into how economic factors play a role in human health; this finding could increase awareness among people to consider economic strength as a factor to avoid health issues later in life. Furthermore, the economic conditions and health issues of both American regions could be revealed.
