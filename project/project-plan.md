# Project Plan
## Title
Analyzing the Impact of Socioeconomic Factors on Police Shootings in America: A U.S. County-Level Study
## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How do socioeconomic factors (income, education, poverty, racial composition, and crime) relate to the frequency and distribution of police shootings in U.S. counties?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Nowadays, police firing is a common case in the USA. There are several reasons for this, and it happens more frequently in some areas. I have collected a dataset for U.S. counties that contains socioeconomic information about these counties. I have selected two other datasets for police firing cases. My goal is to explore the main causes of these incidents and identify patterns in certain cities.
